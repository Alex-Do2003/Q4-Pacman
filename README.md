GAME DESCRIPTION:

This game is a replication of the original Pac-Man game. Although it is a repllication of the game, there are indeed some differences in the games. Both of the games have the same objective, to eat all the pixel pellets before losing all your lives. However, our game differ between the maps and other aspects. For example, we have a different layout for our map, we used a happyface as an obstacle. We also did not add the aspect of being able to go though the side border to end up on the other side of the map. Lastly, the last change we made was that the ghost were the same orange color instead of having them be different colors


USAGE:

Spacebar: to start/restart game

The Arrow Keys: to move the pacman character

We made two different methods for each screen. One for the intitial starting screen as well as the winning screen. We later call these methods in our paintComponent method.

There were multiple methods to have the ghost fully fuctional. We first needed a method to draw the ghost on to our program. We created another method to give the ghosts randomized movements.

We used multiple methods to get our pacman character fuctional. Similar to the ghost methods we needed to create a method to draw our pacman onto our program. We needed for different images for our pacment for each direcetion: up, down, left, and right. Then we created the actual movment method for our character.

In this method, we created the borders and obstavle of our maze. 

UPDATES:

In the future, we would most likey fix some bugs or glitches in the game. We might include some different obstacles or new maps to add to the complexity of the game. We might also include the aspect of being able to travel from oneside of the map to another by leaving the border of the game.
